# Instructions

## Notes

Your notes for today should include:

* The date.
* A title -- maybe "Playtesting" for the main title.
* Notes of the class discussion (you can use the [slides][] for review).
* A title for each game you tested.
* Notes on each game.

## Playtesting

1. Playtest *at least* three of your classmates' modifications to Tic-Tac-Toe. Each round of testing should take you about 10 minutes. You should play each game several times to throughly explore the gameplay. As you test:
  * **Take notes.** In your notes record:
    - The game you played and who designed it.
    - Who you played with.
    - Problems and/or questions you encountered.
    - Differences between this game and Tic-Tac-Toe.
  * Look for patterns:
    - Who wins.
    - Do all of the players have a chance to win?
    - How often do you draw?
1. After playtesting, pick up a copy of the **Tic Tac Toe Playtest Reports** handout and complete a page for each game that you played. Use your notes for reference.
 * Write a short paragraph -- two or three sentances at least -- for each section. **Do not** use one word answers, they don't convey enough information to be useful to the reader.
 * Be specific -- even if the game was perfect, it will help the designer to know what makes it perfect **to you.** If you ran into problems or confusion, try to explain it clearly enough that the designer can understand and use your feed back. After reading your feedback the designer should know:
  - **What** you like about their game (not just that you liked it), or
  - **Where** you encountered programs, or
  - **Why** you didn't like the game.

The [slides][] are available if you want to review them.
